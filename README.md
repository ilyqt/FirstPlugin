# FirstPlugin

FirstPlugin I ever made. I added some stuff onto it recently to make the code a bit cleaner.

The Code Includes:
- Simple Join Event
- Simple Event to prevent damage
- Simple command that send the player a message
- Made a Utils and PlayerCommand class to make writing commands and messages easier.
- Check the "FirstCommand" class for all commands, aliases, and perms.
